## ✨ Overview

**Manifold of Life** reimagines the classic Conway's Game of Life by extending it to non-Euclidean topological surfaces. Watch cellular automata evolve on tori, Klein bottles, Möbius strips, and more—each with unique wrapping behavior that creates fascinating emergent patterns.

Built in **under a minute** using AI-assisted development (Kimi K2.5), this project demonstrates the power of modern AI tools for rapid prototyping and creative exploration.

## 🌐 Topologies

Explore cellular automata across seven distinct topological surfaces:

| Topology | Description | Wrapping Behavior | Euler Characteristic |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Torus** | Classic donut shape | Wraps horizontally & vertically | χ = 0 |
| **Double Torus** | Figure-8 genus-2 surface | Complex bidirectional wrapping | χ = -2 |
| **Sphere** | Bounded spherical surface | No wrapping, edges constrained | χ = 2 |
| **Klein Bottle** | Non-orientable surface | Twisted vertical wrapping | χ = 0 |
| **Cylinder** | Cylindrical surface | Wraps circumferentially only | χ = 0 |
| **Möbius Strip** | Single-sided twisted band | Non-orientable wrapping | χ = 0 |
| **Plane** | Flat 2D grid | No wrapping, bounded edges | χ = 1 |

### Topological Properties

Each surface exhibits unique mathematical properties:
- **Genus**: Number of "holes" (Torus: 1, Double Torus: 2, Sphere: 0)
- **Orientability**: Whether the surface has distinct "sides"
- **Boundary**: Some surfaces (Plane, Cylinder) have edges, others are closed

## 🧬 Cellular Automaton Rules

Switch between five different CA rulesets:

### 1. **Conway's Life** (B3/S23) - *Default*
The original! A cell is born with 3 neighbors, survives with 2-3 neighbors.
- **Characteristics**: Stable patterns (gliders, blinkers), explosive growth, eventual equilibrium

### 2. **Seeds** (B2/S)
Explosive rule where cells are born with 2 neighbors but never survive.
- **Characteristics**: Rapid expansion, fills space quickly, chaotic dynamics

### 3. **HighLife** (B36/S23)
Extension of Conway's Life that introduces replicators.
- **Characteristics**: Self-replicating patterns, more complex emergent structures

### 4. **Day & Night** (B3678/S34678)
Symmetric rule where live/dead cells follow similar dynamics.
- **Characteristics**: Balanced populations, intricate symmetric patterns

### 5. **Maze** (B3/S12345)
Generates intricate maze-like structures with long-lived cells.
- **Characteristics**: Persistent structures, labyrinthine patterns

## 🎨 Visual Effects

## 🧠 AI-Assisted Development

This project was built using **Kimi K2.5** (Moonshot AI) in **under a minute**, demonstrating:
- Rapid prototyping with AI pair programming
- Iterative refinement through conversational coding
- Cost-effective development (built for cents!)

> "Insanely brutal what you can build if you know what to ask."

The entire codebase—including Three.js setup, topology math, CA logic, and UI—was generated through natural language prompts and refined through quick iterations.
